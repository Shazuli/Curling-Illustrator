# Curling-Illustrator

Got sick of seeing my teacher drawing stones in MS Paint in class, so I made this program to make it a bit more professional.

### How to run

You will need [Java 8](https://www.java.com/en/download/) to run it. You can check if you have it installed by searching for `java` in the search bar. If you don't get a match go and install it, if you do it will either say which version it is in the name or click on the settings app and in the window that open click on the "about" button.

Then you simply double click `Curling-Illustrator.jar`. If it opens a already installed application (ex. [WinRar](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0)) and shows some files it means you have to change the default program to open it with. Change it to Java in that case or right click `Curling-Illustrator.jar` and click "Open with another application".
